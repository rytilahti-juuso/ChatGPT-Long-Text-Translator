The output is broken down into chunks and as the translation process progressess the
chunks are written here with the naming scheme chunk<index>original.md and
 chunk<index>_translation.md. This is done for debug purposes.

 NOTE: Once the script execution has ended, output.md includes the whole, final version of the translation!.
